First I would like to sincerely thank my supervisor, Prof. Phil Woodland, for his guidance and patience throughout my fourth-year project. Thank you for all your motivations and inspirations every time I got lost in exploring the wide variety of aspects in the project. The critical thinking skills that I've learned from the weekly meetings would definitely be helpful in my future career.

I would also like to thank my project advisor, Dr. Chao Zhang, for all his valuable suggestions and great support on my project. Working with people in the speech group has also been delightful, despite the fact that my project actually has limited relation with speech.

Finally I would like to thank my parents who have acted as therapists during my entire fourth year, and also my best friends who have made my life in Cambridge interesting.
