\chapter{Risk Assessment Retrospective} 

This is a software project. Previously identified potential risks include:
\begin{enumerate}
	\item tripping and falling due to improper wiring
	\item eyesight damage and back pain due to prolonged use of computers
\end{enumerate}
These potential risks have been avoided by proper wiring and taking a rest or exercise before using computers for too long. No other risks happened during the project.

If the risk assessment were to be done again, I would not change anything in the assessment form.
